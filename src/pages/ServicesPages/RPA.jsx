          Robotic Process Automation (RPA) is a technology that uses software
          robots to automate repetitive, rule-based tasks. These software robots
          can mimic human actions, interacting with applications and systems to
          perform tasks that were previously done manually. RPA has emerged as a
          powerful tool for businesses looking to improve efficiency, reduce
          costs, and enhance accuracy.
          <br />
          <br />
          One of the key benefits of RPA is its ability to automate repetitive
          tasks that are prone to human error. By eliminating manual
          intervention, RPA can significantly reduce the risk of mistakes and
          ensure consistency in processes. This can lead to improved quality and
          compliance, as well as reduced operational costs.
